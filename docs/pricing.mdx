## Upgrading to Pro

When you hit your quota, Catty prompts you to upgrade:

```bash
$ catty new
Error: Monthly quota exceeded.

To continue using Catty, upgrade to Pro ($25/month).
Opening checkout in your browser...
```

The CLI automatically opens checkout in your browser. After completing payment:

1. Your account is upgraded to Pro
2. Run `catty new` again to start a session

<Tip>
  Quota resets monthly. If you're close to the limit near month-end, you can wait for the reset instead of upgrading.

    You can't create new sessions until your quota resets (monthly) or you upgrade to Pro. Existing sessions continue working.

    No. Session machines (cloud compute) are included in both plans.
