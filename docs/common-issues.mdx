Solutions to problems you might encounter when using Catty.

## Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not logged in error">
    **Error:** `Not logged in. Run 'catty login' to authenticate.`

    **Solution:** Run `catty login` to authenticate. If you've already logged in, your credentials may have expired.

    ```bash
    catty login
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing authorization header">
    **Error:** `missing authorization header`

    **Causes:**
    - CLI isn't sending the auth token
    - Outdated CLI version (npm may have cached an old binary)

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify you're logged in: `cat ~/.catty/credentials.json`
    2. Re-login: `catty login`
    3. Update the CLI: `npm update -g @diggerhq/catty`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="502 errors after API update">
    **Error:** 502 Bad Gateway errors when creating sessions

    **Cause:** API redeployment may invalidate some tokens

    **Solution:** Re-authenticate:
    ```bash
    catty logout
    catty login
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Login fails with authentication error">
    **Error:** Authentication fails

    **Cause:** Server-side configuration issue

    **Solution:** This is likely a temporary service issue. Try again in a few minutes. If it persists, report the issue.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection drops after ~60 seconds">
    **Symptom:** Terminal disconnects after being idle

    **Expected behavior:** Catty sends keepalive pings every 25 seconds to prevent this

    **Solutions:**
    1. Reconnect with `catty connect <label>`
    2. Check your network connection
    3. If persistent, report the issue with your network setup details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WebSocket connection failed">
    **Error:** Unable to establish WebSocket connection

    **Causes:**
    - Network firewall blocking WebSocket
    - Proxy server interfering
    - Session machine not ready

    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait a few seconds and try again
    2. Check if your network allows WebSocket connections
    3. Try from a different network
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session not found">
    **Error:** Session with label `xyz` not found

    **Causes:**
    - Session was stopped
    - Session TTL expired
    - Typo in label

    **Solutions:**
    1. Run `catty list` to see available sessions
    2. Create a new session with `catty new`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workspace Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspace files not appearing">
    **Symptom:** Claude doesn't see your uploaded files

    **Causes:**
    - Upload failed silently
    - Files excluded by `.gitignore`
    - Upload size exceeded

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check CLI output for "Workspace uploaded" confirmation
    2. Review your `.gitignore` - files matching patterns aren't uploaded
    3. Ensure workspace is under 100 MB
    4. Try `catty new` again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload too large">
    **Error:** Workspace exceeds 100 MB limit

    **Solutions:**
    1. Add large files/directories to `.gitignore`:
       ```
       # .gitignore
       dist/
       build/
       *.zip
       large-data/
       ```
    2. Use `--no-upload` and clone your repo in the session:
       ```bash
       catty new --no-upload
       # Then in Claude: git clone https://github.com/...
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sync-back not working">
    **Symptom:** Changes Claude makes don't appear locally

    **Causes:**
    - `--no-sync-back` flag was used
    - WebSocket disconnected
    - File outside `/workspace`

    **Solutions:**
    1. Reconnect without `--no-sync-back`: `catty connect <label>`
    2. Ensure Claude is editing files in `/workspace`
    3. Check that you're in the correct local directory
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Files syncing to wrong location">
    **Symptom:** Synced files appear in unexpected places

    **Cause:** You're in a different directory than when you created the session

    **Solution:** Navigate to the original directory before reconnecting:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/original/directory
    catty connect <label>
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Claude Code Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude shows login prompt">
    **Symptom:** Claude Code asks you to log in

    **Expected behavior:** This should be pre-configured and shouldn't happen

    **Solution:** This is a bug. Report it with the exact prompt you see.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude shows API key prompt">
    **Symptom:** Claude asks to approve API key

    **Expected behavior:** The API key should be pre-approved

    **Solution:** This is a bug. The wrapper script should handle this. Report the issue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude can't find tools (ls, grep, etc.)">
    **Symptom:** Claude reports missing tools

    **Cause:** Possibly using an outdated executor image

    **Solution:** This is a server-side issue. The executor should have all tools pre-installed. Report the issue.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quota exceeded error">
    **Error:** `Monthly token quota exceeded`

    **Solutions:**
    1. Upgrade to Pro when prompted
    2. Wait for monthly quota reset
    3. Check when your quota resets (beginning of billing cycle)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Checkout page doesn't load">
    **Symptom:** Browser opens but Stripe checkout fails

    **Solutions:**
    1. Try a different browser
    2. Disable browser extensions that might block Stripe
    3. Check your network connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment succeeded but still hitting quota">
    **Symptom:** Paid for Pro but quota error persists

    **Cause:** Webhook may be delayed

    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait a few minutes for webhook processing
    2. Try `catty new` again
    3. If persistent, contact support with your payment confirmation
  </Accordion>
