A session is an isolated cloud machine running Claude Code. Each session has a memorable label like "brave-tiger-1234" for easy reference.

## Creating Sessions

Start a new session with:

```bash
catty new
```

This will:
1. Create a new cloud machine
2. Upload your current directory (see [Workspace Sync](/workspace-sync))
3. Start Claude Code
4. Connect your terminal

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-upload` | Skip uploading current directory |
| `--no-sync-back` | Disable real-time file sync back to local |
| `--api <url>` | Override API URL (for development) |
| `--agent codex` | Use Codex instead of Claude Code (experimental) |

### Examples

```bash
# Standard session with workspace upload
catty new

# Session without uploading files
catty new --no-upload

# Session without sync-back
catty new --no-sync-back
```

## Session Labels

Each session gets a memorable label like:

- `brave-tiger-1234`
- `swift-falcon-5678`
- `clever-dolphin-9012`

Labels are easier to remember than UUIDs and are used for all session operations.

## Listing Sessions

View all your sessions:

```bash
catty list
```

Output shows:
- Session label
- Status (running, stopped)
- Creation time

## Reconnecting

Sessions persist until explicitly stopped. Reconnect to an existing session:

```bash
catty connect brave-tiger-1234
```

<Tip>
  Use Tab completion with the session label for convenience.
</Tip>

### Reconnect Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-sync-back` | Disable sync-back for this connection |

```bash
# Reconnect without sync-back
catty connect brave-tiger-1234 --no-sync-back
```

## Stopping Sessions

Stop a running session:

```bash
catty stop brave-tiger-1234
```

<Warning>
  Stopping a session destroys the cloud machine. Any files not synced back will be lost.
</Warning>
