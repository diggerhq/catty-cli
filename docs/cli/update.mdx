Updates the Catty CLI to the latest version from npm.

## Synopsis

```bash
catty update
```

## What Happens

1. Checks npm for latest version
2. Compares with installed version
3. Prompts to confirm update
4. Runs `npm install -g @diggerhq/catty`

## Auto-Update Prompts

Catty automatically checks for updates after each command. If a new version is available:

- You'll see a prompt to update
- If you decline, it won't ask again for 2 days

## Manual Update
