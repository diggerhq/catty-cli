title: "catty download"
description: "Download workspace from a session"
---

Downloads a workspace snapshot from a session to your local machine. Works for both running and stopped sessions.

## Synopsis

```bash
catty download <label> [path] [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `label` | Session label (e.g., `brave-tiger-1234`) |
| `path` | Destination path (default: `./<label>`) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--format <type>` | Output format: `dir` (default) or `tar.gz` |

## Examples

```bash
# Download to a new directory named after the session
catty download brave-tiger-1234
# Creates: ./brave-tiger-1234/

# Download to a specific path
catty download brave-tiger-1234 ./my-backup

# Download as a tarball
catty download brave-tiger-1234 --format tar.gz
# Creates: ./brave-tiger-1234.tar.gz

# Download tarball to specific path
catty download brave-tiger-1234 ./backup.tar.gz --format tar.gz
```

## How It Works

1. Fetches the latest workspace snapshot from cloud storage
2. Downloads the tarball
3. Extracts to destination (or saves as tarball with `--format tar.gz`)

## When to Use

- After stopping a session to retrieve your work
- To get a backup of a running session
- When sync-back was disabled
- After unexpected disconnection

<Note>
  Workspaces are saved every 30 seconds (first save ~10 seconds after session start). If you just created a session, wait a moment before downloading.
</Note>

## What's Included

The download includes everything in `/workspace` except:

```
.git/
node_modules/
__pycache__/
.venv/
venv/
.cache/
.npm/
.yarn/
```

## Error: No Workspace Found

If you see "No workspace snapshot found":

- The session may have just started (wait 30 seconds)
- Cloud persistence may not be enabled for older sessions
- The session may have failed before first save
