title: "catty new"
description: "Start a new remote Claude Code session"
---

Creates a new cloud machine, uploads your workspace, and connects your terminal to Claude Code.

## Synopsis

```bash
catty new [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-upload` | Don't upload current directory |
| `--no-sync-back` | Disable real-time sync of remote changes to local |
| `--no-auto-reconnect` | Disable automatic reconnection on disconnect |
| `--no-secrets` | Don't pass stored secrets to session |
| `--enable-prompts` | Enable permission prompts (default: auto-approve all) |
| `--agent <name>` | Agent to use: `claude` (default) or `codex` |
| `--api <url>` | Override API URL |

## What Happens

1. Creates a new cloud machine
2. Uploads current directory to `/workspace` (unless `--no-upload`)
3. Passes your [secrets](/concepts/secrets) as environment variables (unless `--no-secrets`)
4. Starts Claude Code with auto-approved permissions
5. Connects your terminal via WebSocket
6. Enables [sync-back](/concepts/sync-back) (unless `--no-sync-back`)
7. Starts [cloud persistence](/concepts/workspaces#cloud-persistence) (saves every 30s)

## Examples

```bash
# Standard session - uploads current directory
catty new

# Start without uploading workspace
catty new --no-upload

# Start without sync-back
catty new --no-sync-back

# Enable permission prompts (instead of auto-approving)
catty new --enable-prompts

# Start without passing secrets
catty new --no-secrets

# Combine options
catty new --no-upload --no-sync-back
```

## Output

```
Creating session...
Session created: brave-tiger-1234
  Reconnect with: catty connect brave-tiger-1234
  Sync-back: enabled (remote changes will sync to local)
Secrets: GITHUB_TOKEN, GH_TOKEN
Uploading workspace...
Workspace uploaded (2.3 MB)
Connecting...
```

## Exiting

- Press `Ctrl+C` to disconnect (session keeps running)
- Type `/exit` in Claude Code to end the session
- Run `catty stop <label>` from another terminal

<Tip>
  After disconnecting, reconnect with `catty connect <label>`. The session persists until you explicitly stop it.
