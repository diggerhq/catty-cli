title: "catty connect"
description: "Reconnect to an existing session"
---

Reconnects your terminal to a running session. Use this after disconnecting or to connect from a different machine.

## Synopsis

```bash
catty connect <label> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `label` | Session label (e.g., `brave-tiger-1234`) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-sync-back` | Disable sync-back for this connection |
| `--no-auto-reconnect` | Disable automatic reconnection on disconnect |

## Examples

```bash
# Reconnect to a session
catty connect brave-tiger-1234

# Reconnect without sync-back
catty connect brave-tiger-1234 --no-sync-back

# Reconnect without auto-reconnect
catty connect brave-tiger-1234 --no-auto-reconnect
```

## Finding Session Labels

Use `catty list` to see your sessions:

```bash
$ catty list
LABEL                STATUS    CREATED
brave-tiger-1234     running   2 hours ago
swift-falcon-5678    running   5 minutes ago
```

## Auto-Reconnect

By default, if your connection drops (network issue, laptop sleep), Catty automatically attempts to reconnect. Disable this with `--no-auto-reconnect`.

## Sync-Back on Reconnect

When you reconnect, sync-back starts fresh. Changes made while disconnected aren't automatically synced - use `catty sync <label>` to pull them.

<Tip>
  Connect from a different directory than where you created the session? Sync-back will write files to your current directory, which may not be what you want.
