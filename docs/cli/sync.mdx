Downloads a workspace snapshot and extracts it to your current directory, overwriting existing files.

## Synopsis

```bash
catty sync <label> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `label` | Session label (e.g., `brave-tiger-1234`) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be synced without making changes |

## Examples

```bash
# Preview what would be synced
catty sync brave-tiger-1234 --dry-run

## Difference from Download

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `catty download` | Creates a new directory with the workspace |
| `catty sync` | Overwrites files in current directory |

Use `download` for backups. Use `sync` to update your working directory.

<Warning>
  `catty sync` overwrites local files with remote versions. Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes.
</Warning>

## When to Use

- Pull changes made while you were disconnected
- Recover files if sync-back was disabled
