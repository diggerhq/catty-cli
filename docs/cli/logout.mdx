Deletes your locally stored credentials.

## Synopsis

```bash
catty logout
```

## What Happens

Deletes `~/.catty/credentials.json`. You'll need to run `catty login` to authenticate again.

<Note>
  This only removes local credentials. It doesn't invalidate tokens on the server or affect running sessions.
