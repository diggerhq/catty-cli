---

During an active session, you can upload images and documents for Claude to view and work with by dragging and dropping file paths into your terminal.

## How It Works

1. Drag a file from Finder/Explorer into your terminal
2. The file path appears in the input
3. Press Enter
4. Catty detects the file and uploads it
5. The file is available at `/workspace/.catty-uploads/<filename>`
6. Claude can view and work with the file

## Supported File Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Images" icon="image">
    PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP, BMP, SVG
  </Card>

  <Card title="Documents" icon="file">
    PDF, TXT, MD, JSON, XML, CSV
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Maximum file size | 10 MB |
| Path type | Absolute paths only |

## Examples

```bash
# Drag and drop a screenshot
/Users/you/Desktop/Screenshot 2024-12-17.png

# Upload a PDF for Claude to analyze
/Users/you/Documents/report.pdf

# Multiple files (space-separated)
/path/to/image1.png /path/to/image2.png
```

<Tip>
  Paths with spaces are automatically handled. Both `/path/to/my file.png` and `/path/to/my\ file.png` work.
</Tip>

## Where Files Land

Uploaded files go to:

```
/workspace/.catty-uploads/<filename>
```

Claude can reference them there:

```
Claude, please analyze the image at /workspace/.catty-uploads/screenshot.png
```

## Use Cases

- Share screenshots of bugs or UI issues
- Upload PDFs for Claude to extract information
- Provide reference images for design work
- Share CSV data for analysis
