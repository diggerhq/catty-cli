With a GitHub token configured, Claude can clone private repositories, push commits, and create pull requests using Git and the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

<Note>
  GitHub integration is built on [Secrets](/concepts/secrets). The `catty secrets add github` command provides a guided setup specifically for GitHub tokens.
</Note>

## Setup

Run the guided setup:

```bash
catty secrets add github
```

This will:

1. Open GitHub's token creation page in your browser
2. Prompt you to paste the generated token
3. Validate the token works
4. Save both `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` (for compatibility)

## Required Token Scopes

When creating the token on GitHub, select:

- **`repo`** - Full control of private repositories

This is sufficient for most workflows. Add more scopes only if needed.

## What Claude Can Do

With a GitHub token, Claude can:

| Action | Example Command |
|--------|-----------------|
| Clone private repos | `git clone https://github.com/yourorg/private-repo` |
| Push commits | `git push origin main` |
| Create branches | `git checkout -b feature-branch` |
| Create pull requests | `gh pr create --title "Add feature"` |
| Manage issues | `gh issue create --title "Bug report"` |
| Review PRs | `gh pr view 123` |

## Example Session

```bash
# Start a session (GitHub token is automatically passed)
catty new --no-upload

# Claude can now work with your private repos
> Clone https://github.com/yourorg/my-app and add a new API endpoint

# Claude runs:
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/my-app
cd my-app
# ... makes changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new API endpoint"
git push origin main
gh pr create --title "Add new API endpoint" --body "..."
```

## Verifying Setup

Test your token:

```bash
catty secrets test github
```

Output:
```
Testing GitHub token...
✓ Token valid (user: yourname)
```

## Token Storage

The token is stored encrypted at `~/.catty/secrets.json` using AES-256-GCM. It's only decrypted when starting a session and sent over HTTPS. See [Secrets](/concepts/secrets) for encryption details.

## Session Environment

Inside the session:

```bash
# Both variables are set
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
echo $GH_TOKEN

# gh CLI auto-detects the token
gh auth status
# → Logged in to github.com as yourname
```

## Updating Your Token

```bash
# Remove old token
catty secrets remove GITHUB_TOKEN

# Add new token
catty secrets add github
```

## Revoking Access

If you need to revoke access:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Revoke the token
3. Remove from Catty: `catty secrets remove GITHUB_TOKEN`
