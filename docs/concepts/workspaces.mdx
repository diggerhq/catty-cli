Your workspace is the `/workspace` directory in a session. It starts with your uploaded files and is automatically saved to the cloud throughout the session.

## Upload on Session Start

When you run `catty new`, your current directory is zipped and uploaded:

```bash
cd my-project
catty new
# → Uploading workspace...
# → Workspace uploaded (2.3 MB)
```

### What Gets Uploaded

Your entire current directory, **except**:

- Files matching patterns in `.gitignore`
- Default exclusions (see below)

### Default Exclusions

Always excluded, regardless of `.gitignore`:

```
node_modules/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/
venv/
.env
.DS_Store
*.log
```

<Tip>
  Add patterns to your `.gitignore` to exclude additional files.
</Tip>

### Git Directory

The `.git` directory is uploaded by default, enabling git operations in your session. To exclude it:

```bash
catty new --no-git
```

### Upload Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Maximum size | 100 MB |

If your workspace exceeds 100 MB:

1. Add large files to `.gitignore`
2. Or use `--no-upload` and clone your repo in the session:

```bash
catty new --no-upload
# Then in Claude: git clone https://github.com/...
```

### Skipping Upload

```bash
catty new --no-upload
```

Useful when:
- Workspace is too large
- You want an empty session
- You'll clone a repo instead

## Cloud Persistence

Workspaces are automatically saved to cloud storage throughout the session.

### How It Works

1. **First save**: ~10 seconds after session start
2. **Periodic saves**: Every 30 seconds
3. **Final save**: When session stops

### What Gets Saved

Everything in `/workspace` **except**:

```
.git/
node_modules/
__pycache__/
.venv/
venv/
.cache/
.npm/
.yarn/
```

### Why This Matters

- **Recovery**: Download your work even after stopping a session
- **Backup**: Get a snapshot of a running session
- **Resilience**: Don't lose work if sync-back was disabled or you disconnected

## Downloading Workspaces

### To a New Directory

```bash
catty download brave-tiger-1234
# Creates: ./brave-tiger-1234/
```

### To a Specific Path

```bash
catty download brave-tiger-1234 ./my-backup
```

### As a Tarball

```bash
catty download brave-tiger-1234 --format tar.gz
```

## Syncing to Current Directory

Overwrite your current directory with the remote workspace:

```bash
# Preview first
catty sync brave-tiger-1234 --dry-run

# Then sync
catty sync brave-tiger-1234
```

<Warning>
  `catty sync` overwrites local files. Use `--dry-run` first.
</Warning>
