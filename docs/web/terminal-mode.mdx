Terminal Mode provides a complete terminal experience using [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), the same technology powering VS Code's integrated terminal.

## Features

- **Full ANSI color support** - See Claude's colorized output exactly as intended
- **WebGL acceleration** - Smooth rendering even with heavy output
- **Clickable links** - URLs in terminal output are clickable
- **10,000 line scrollback** - Scroll back through session history
- **Automatic resize** - Terminal adapts to window and orientation changes

## Using Terminal Mode

Terminal Mode works just like a native terminal:

- Type commands and messages directly
- Use arrow keys to navigate command history
- Scroll to view previous output
- Copy text by selecting it (browser copy)

On mobile, tap the terminal to bring up your device keyboard. Use the virtual keyboard for special keys like Ctrl+C and arrow keys.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All standard terminal shortcuts work:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt current operation |
| `Ctrl+D` | Send EOF (end of input) |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Suspend process |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen |
| `Ctrl+A` | Move cursor to start of line |
| `Ctrl+E` | Move cursor to end of line |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate command history |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete |

## Connection Status

The status bar at the bottom shows connection state:

- **Connected** (green) - Active WebSocket connection
- **Connecting** (amber, pulsing) - Establishing connection
- **Disconnected** (red) - Connection lost

If disconnected, the terminal displays the reason:
- "Connection replaced by another client" - You connected from another browser/tab
- "Connection timeout" - No data received for 75 seconds
- "Process exited with code X" - Claude Code process ended

## Switching to Chat Mode

Tap the chat icon in the header to switch to [Chat Mode](/web/chat-mode). Both modes connect to the same session - switching doesn't interrupt your work.

## Visual Theme

Terminal Mode uses a dark theme optimized for readability:

```
Background:  #0a0a0f (near black)
Foreground:  #e8e8f0 (soft white)
Cursor:      #00ff88 (green)
```

The color palette supports full ANSI 256 colors for syntax highlighting and styled output.

## Performance

Terminal Mode is optimized for performance:

- **WebGL rendering** - GPU-accelerated when available, falls back to canvas
- **Efficient updates** - Only redraws changed regions
- **Scrollback limit** - 10,000 lines prevents memory issues
- **Binary protocol** - Raw PTY data for minimal latency

## Troubleshooting

**Terminal appears blank**

Wait a few seconds for the connection to establish. If it stays blank, check the status bar for connection errors.

**Input not working**

Tap/click the terminal to ensure it has focus. On mobile, this should bring up the keyboard.

**Garbled output**

Try refreshing the page. Some terminal applications may not render correctly if you connected mid-output.

**Slow or laggy**

WebGL may not be available. Check browser console for WebGL errors. Try a different browser or device.
