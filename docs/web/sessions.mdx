The sessions dashboard at [app.catty.dev](https://app.catty.dev) shows all your Claude Code sessions and lets you manage them from anywhere.

## Sessions Dashboard

**Running sessions** appear at the top with a green indicator. Tap to connect.

**Stopped sessions** appear below with a gray indicator. These can't be reconnected, but their workspace snapshots remain available for download via CLI.

Each session shows:
- **Label** - Human-readable name (e.g., `brave-tiger-1234`)
- **Region** - Where it's running (e.g., "US East")
- **Created** - When it started (e.g., "2h ago")

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. Tap the refresh button to update manually.

## Running Multiple Sessions

Run as many sessions as you need in parallel - different projects, different tasks. The dashboard shows them all in one place, making it easy to switch between them from your phone.

Common patterns:
- One session per project you're actively working on
- Long-running tasks you check periodically
- Experiments you want to compare side-by-side

## Creating a Session

Tap **+ New Session** to create a session from the web:

1. **Select region** - Choose closest to you for best latency
2. **Select duration** - How long before auto-stop (1-8 hours)
3. **Create** - You'll connect automatically when ready

<Note>
Web-created sessions start with an empty workspace. To upload local files, create sessions with `catty new` from the CLI instead.
</Note>

**Available regions:**
- US East (Virginia), US West (San Jose)
- Europe (London, Frankfurt)
- Asia Pacific (Sydney, Tokyo)

## Stopping a Session

Tap the red **Stop** button on any running session. Stopped sessions:
- Can't be reconnected
- Keep their workspace snapshot in cloud storage
- Can be downloaded via CLI with `catty download <label>`

## Connection Status

When connected to a session, the status bar shows:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected** (green) | Active connection |
| **Connecting** (amber) | Establishing connection |
| **Disconnected** (red) | Connection lost |

If disconnected, tap **Retry** to reconnect. Common disconnect reasons:
- Network interruption
- Session was stopped
- Connected from another device (replaces previous connection)
