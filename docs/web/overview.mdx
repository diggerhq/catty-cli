The Catty web app at [app.catty.dev](https://app.catty.dev) brings Claude Code to your phone. Start sessions from your laptop with the CLI, then monitor and interact with them from anywhere.

## Why Mobile?

## Two View Modes

| Mode | Best For | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| [Chat Mode](/web/chat-mode) | Phones | Clean bubbles, quick action buttons (`y`, `n`, `Enter`, `Esc`) |
| [Terminal Mode](/web/terminal-mode) | Tablets, desktops | Full xterm.js with colors, scrollback, all shortcuts |

Tap the toggle in the header to switch. Both connect to the same session.

## Virtual Keyboard

On mobile, a virtual keyboard provides terminal-specific keys:

| Keys | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ESC, TAB | Navigation |
| ^C, ^D, ^Z, ^L | Control signals |
| ↑ ↓ ← → | Arrow keys |
| Backspace, Enter | Editing |

Tap the keyboard icon to show/hide. Use your device keyboard for regular text input.

## CLI vs Mobile

| Capability | CLI | Mobile |
|------------|-----|--------|
| Create sessions | Yes | Yes |
| Upload workspace | Yes | No |
| File sync-back | Yes | No |
| Connect from phone | No | Yes |

**Typical workflow:** Create sessions with `catty new` from the CLI to upload your code, then monitor and interact from your phone.
