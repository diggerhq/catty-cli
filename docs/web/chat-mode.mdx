Chat Mode presents Claude's responses as clean chat bubbles, filtering out terminal noise. Best for phones and quick interactions.

## Quick Action Buttons

One-tap buttons for common inputs:

| Button | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| `y` / `n` | Yes/no confirmations |
| `1` / `2` | Menu selections |
| `↑` / `↓` | Command history |
| `Enter` | Confirm |
| `Esc` | Cancel |
| `^C` | Interrupt |

## Sending Messages

Type in the input field and tap **Send**. Messages go directly to the terminal. The input preserves exact text (no autocorrect).

## What Gets Filtered

Chat Mode strips terminal formatting for readability:
- ANSI color codes
- Box drawing characters
- Progress bars and spinners
- System prompts and hints

If you need to see raw output, switch to [Terminal Mode](/web/terminal-mode).

## Switching Modes

Tap **Terminal** in the header. Both modes connect to the same session - switching doesn't interrupt your work.
