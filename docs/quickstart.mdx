Get started with Catty in three simple steps.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm or npx

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install the CLI globally via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @diggerhq/catty
    ```
    Or use npx without installing:
    ```bash
    npx @diggerhq/catty new
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Login">
    Authenticate with Catty (one-time setup):
    ```bash
    catty login
    ```
    This opens your browser for authentication. Once complete, your credentials are stored locally.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a Session">
    Navigate to your project directory and start a new session:
    ```bash
    cd my-project
    catty new
    ```
    This creates a cloud machine, uploads your directory, and connects you to Claude Code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You're now connected to Claude Code running in the cloud. Work with it just like you would locally - all changes sync back to your local directory in real-time.

## Reconnecting to Sessions

Sessions persist until stopped. Reconnect using the session label:

```bash
catty connect brave-tiger-1234
```

List your sessions:

```bash
catty list
```

## Downloading Your Work

Workspaces are automatically saved to the cloud. Download anytime:

```bash
catty download brave-tiger-1234
```
