## Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @diggerhq/catty
```

Or use npx without installing:

```bash
npx @diggerhq/catty new
```

## Create a Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login">
    Authenticate with Catty (one-time):
    ```bash
    catty login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a Session">
    Navigate to your project and start a session:
    ```bash
    cd my-project
    catty new
    ```
    This uploads your directory and connects you to Claude Code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You're now connected. Work with Claude Code just like you would locally - file changes sync back in real-time.

## Connect From Your Phone

Your session is running in the cloud. Open [app.catty.dev](https://app.catty.dev) on your phone to:

- See all your sessions on one dashboard
- Connect and interact using Chat Mode
- Answer prompts with quick action buttons

Close your laptop and check in from anywhere. Start multiple sessions for different projects - manage them all from your phone.

## CLI Basics

Reconnect to a session:
```bash
catty connect brave-tiger-1234
```

List your sessions:
```bash
catty list
```

Download your workspace:
```bash
catty download brave-tiger-1234
```
