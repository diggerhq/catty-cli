Answers to common questions about Catty.

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Catty?">
    Catty is a platform that runs Claude Code in persistent cloud sessions. It streams the terminal to your local machine, giving you a native experience while the AI runs remotely.

    Key features:
    - Sessions persist even when you disconnect
    - Run multiple sessions in parallel
    - Automatic workspace upload and sync-back
    - Reconnect from anywhere
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from running Claude Code locally?">
    | Aspect | Catty | Local Claude Code |
    |--------|-------|-------------------|
    | Persistence | Sessions keep running when you disconnect | Stops when terminal closes |
    | Parallel sessions | Run multiple sessions simultaneously | One session per terminal |
    | Location | Reconnect from any machine | Tied to one machine |
    | File sync | Automatic bidirectional | N/A (already local) |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is Catty for?">
    Catty is ideal for:
    - Developers who want sessions that persist across disconnects
    - Anyone who needs to run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel
    - Users who work from different locations
    - Teams that want automatic file sync between local and remote
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Platform Support

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What platforms are supported?">
    **Supported:**
    - macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
    - Linux (x64 and ARM64)

    **Not yet supported:**
    - Windows

    Windows support is on the roadmap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Node.js version do I need?">
    Node.js 18 or later is required to install the CLI via npm.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Catty without npm?">
    Not currently. The CLI is distributed via npm. You can use `npx @diggerhq/catty` without a global install.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sessions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple sessions?">
    Yes! You can run multiple sessions in parallel for different projects or tasks. Use `catty list` to see all your active sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do sessions last?">
    Sessions have a TTL (time-to-live) and will auto-stop after extended inactivity. You can also stop them manually with `catty stop`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my files when a session ends?">
    The cloud machine is destroyed when a session stops. Any files not synced back to your local machine are lost.

    With sync-back enabled (default), all changes Claude makes are automatically synced to your local directory in real-time, so you won't lose work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I keep a session running in the background?">
    Yes! Sessions persist until stopped. Disconnect with `Ctrl+C` and reconnect later with `catty connect <label>`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my code private?">
    Yes. Each session runs in its own isolated cloud machine. Your workspace files exist only on that machine and are deleted when the session ends.

    - Sessions are isolated from each other
    - Only you can access your sessions (via your auth token)
    - No workspace data is persisted after session termination
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my credentials stored?">
    Locally at `~/.catty/credentials.json` with restricted file permissions (0600). Credentials are only sent to the Catty API for authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Catty see my code?">
    Your workspace is uploaded to the session machine, which Catty operates. However:
    - Files are only stored on the ephemeral session machine
    - Files are deleted when the session ends
    - Catty doesn't analyze or store your code beyond the session lifetime
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are API calls logged?">
    Catty doesn't log the content of your API calls to Claude.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does billing work?">
    Catty offers two plans:
    - **Free tier**: Limited usage per month
    - **Pro**: $25/month for higher limits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need my own Anthropic API key?">
    No. Catty provides Claude API access. You don't need your own API key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I hit my quota?">
    You can't create new sessions. Existing sessions continue working. Options:
    1. Wait for monthly reset
    2. Upgrade to Pro
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I pay for the cloud machines?">
    No. Cloud compute costs are included in your plan. You only pay for token usage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What tools are available in the session?">
    Sessions run on Debian (node:22-bookworm) with development tools pre-installed:
    - Node.js 22
    - Git
    - Build tools (gcc, make)
    - ripgrep, jq, vim, curl, wget
    - Python (with pip)
    - And more

    Claude Code has access to all standard Unix tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I install additional packages?">
    Yes, within the session. Use `apt-get`, `npm`, `pip`, etc. However, installations don't persist across sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the upload size limit?">
    100 MB. Use `.gitignore` to exclude large files, or use `--no-upload` and clone your repo in the session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does sync-back handle conflicts?">
    Sync-back is one-way (remote to local). If you edit a file locally while Claude edits it remotely, the remote version will overwrite your local changes.

    **Best practice**: Don't edit files locally during an active session. Let Claude do the work, then review when done.
  </Accordion>
