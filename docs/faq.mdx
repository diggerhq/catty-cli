Answers to common questions about Catty.

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Catty?">
    Catty is a platform that runs Claude Code in persistent cloud sessions. It streams the terminal to your local machine, giving you a native experience while the AI runs remotely.

    Key features:
    - Sessions persist even when you disconnect
    - Workspaces auto-save to the cloud every 30 seconds
    - GitHub integration for private repos
    - Reconnect from anywhere
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from running Claude Code locally?">
    | Aspect | Catty | Local Claude Code |
    |--------|-------|-------------------|
    | Persistence | Sessions keep running when you disconnect | Stops when terminal closes |
    | Cloud backup | Workspace saved every 30s, downloadable anytime | N/A |
    | GitHub access | Claude can clone, push, create PRs | Depends on local setup |
    | Location | Reconnect from any machine | Tied to one machine |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is Catty for?">
    Catty is ideal for:
    - Developers who want sessions that persist across disconnects
    - Users who need cloud backup of their work
    - Anyone working with private GitHub repositories
    - Teams that work from different locations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    - macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
    - Linux (x64 and ARM64)

    **Not yet supported:**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Node.js version do I need?">
    Node.js 18 or later is required to install the CLI via npm.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sessions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long do sessions last?">
    Sessions have a TTL (time-to-live) of 2 hours of inactivity. They can also be stopped manually with `catty stop`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my files when a session ends?">
    Workspaces are automatically saved to the cloud every 30 seconds. When a session stops:

    1. A final save is performed
    2. The cloud machine is terminated
    3. Your files remain in cloud storage
    4. Use `catty download <label>` to retrieve them anytime
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple sessions?">
    Yes! Run multiple sessions in parallel for different projects. Use `catty list` to see all active sessions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Files & Workspaces

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the upload size limit?">
    100 MB. Use `.gitignore` to exclude large files, or use `--no-upload` and clone your repo in the session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does cloud persistence work?">
    Workspaces save automatically:
    - First save: ~10 seconds after session start
    - Periodic saves: Every 30 seconds
    - Final save: When session stops

    Download anytime with `catty download <label>`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between sync-back and download?">
    | Feature | Sync-back | Download |
    |---------|-----------|----------|
    | Timing | Real-time during session | On-demand |
    | Requires connection | Yes | No |
    | Use case | Live collaboration | Backup/recovery |

    Sync-back happens automatically. Download is for retrieving files after the fact.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Secrets & GitHub

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I give Claude access to private repos?">
    Set up a GitHub token:
    ```bash
    catty secrets add github
    ```
    This stores your token securely. Future sessions automatically have GitHub access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are my secrets secure?">
    Yes. Secrets are:
    - Encrypted with AES-256-GCM
    - Stored locally (never on Catty servers)
    - Machine-bound (can't be decrypted elsewhere)
    - Only transmitted over HTTPS
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can Claude do with a GitHub token?">
    With a token that has `repo` scope, Claude can:
    - Clone private repositories
    - Push commits
    - Create branches
    - Create pull requests
    - Manage issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my code private?">
    Yes. Each session runs in its own isolated cloud machine. Your workspace files exist only on that machine and in cloud storage (encrypted, accessible only to you).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my credentials stored?">
    Locally at `~/.catty/credentials.json` with restricted permissions (0600). Credentials are only sent to the Catty API for authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Catty see my code?">
    Your workspace is uploaded to the session machine and saved to cloud storage. However:
    - Only you can access your workspace data
    - Cloud storage is encrypted
    - Catty doesn't analyze or process your code
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
