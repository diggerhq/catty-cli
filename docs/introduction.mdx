Catty is a remote AI agent streaming platform that runs [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) sessions in isolated cloud environments. It streams the terminal directly to your local machine via WebSocket, giving you a native terminal experience while all the heavy lifting happens in the cloud.

## Key Benefits

  <Card title="Sessions Keep Running" icon="clock">
    Start a session at work, close your laptop, reconnect from home. Sessions persist in the cloud until you stop them.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Run Multiple Sessions" icon="layer-group">
    Spin up parallel sessions for different projects or tasks. No risk of losing work if one disconnects.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Two-Way File Sync" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Your workspace uploads automatically, changes sync back in real-time, and you can drag-and-drop images for Claude to see.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Native Terminal Feel" icon="terminal">
    The remote session feels exactly like running Claude Code locally. Same experience, cloud persistence.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @diggerhq/catty

# Login (one-time)

# Claude Code starts with your current directory uploaded
# Any changes Claude makes are synced back automatically
```
