Catty is a remote AI agent streaming platform that runs [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) sessions in isolated cloud environments. It streams the terminal directly to your local machine via WebSocket, giving you a native terminal experience while all the heavy lifting happens in the cloud.

## Key Benefits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sessions Keep Running" icon="clock">
    Start a session at work, close your laptop, reconnect from home. Sessions persist in the cloud until you stop them.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cloud Persistence" icon="cloud">
    Workspaces auto-save every 30 seconds. Download your work anytime, even after stopping a session.
  </Card>

  <Card title="GitHub Integration" icon="github">
    Add your GitHub token once, and Claude can clone private repos, push commits, and create pull requests.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Native Terminal Feel" icon="terminal">
    The remote session feels exactly like running Claude Code locally. Same experience, cloud persistence.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @diggerhq/catty

# Login (one-time)
catty login

# Start a session
catty new

# Claude Code starts with your current directory uploaded
# Changes sync back in real-time
# Workspace saves to cloud every 30 seconds
```
