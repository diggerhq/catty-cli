Catty runs [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) sessions in the cloud. Start sessions from your laptop, then monitor and interact with them from your phone.

## How It Works

Catty has two parts that work together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from your laptop">
    The **CLI** creates sessions and uploads your code. File changes sync back to your local directory in real-time.
    ```bash
    catty new
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue from anywhere">
    The **mobile dashboard** at [app.catty.dev](https://app.catty.dev) shows all your sessions. Connect from your phone to check progress or answer prompts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

| | CLI | Mobile & Web |
|---|-----|--------------|
| **Use for** | Starting sessions | Continuing from anywhere |
| **Uploads code** | Yes | No |
